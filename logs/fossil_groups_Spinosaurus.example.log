    "description": "Ahem. Yes. The Spinosaurus was a very large, carnivorous dinosaur, roughly the size of a T. Rex. Unlike its more famous cousin, however, Spinosaurus seems to have spent a great deal of time in water. Similar to modern crocodiles, this creature lived on a diet of fish AND land-dwelling animals. Personally, I am simply relieved that it did not seek FLYING prey."
